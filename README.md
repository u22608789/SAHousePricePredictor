# SAHousePricePredictor
A program to predict South African house prices to buy based on parameters. Public datasets for johannesburg houses from kaggle are used to train and test the linear regression model.
Original plan was to web scrape for data. Proprty24 and Private Property prohibit automatic data extraction :( Instead we use a public dataset from Kaggle for Johannesburg house prices.
